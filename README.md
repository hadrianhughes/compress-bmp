# compress-bmp

Just a little project after reading the Wiki page on indexed color. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color

A command line tool which takes a .bmp file (raw RGB data) and compresses it by gathering all the colours used into a palette, and replacing the pixels with a reference to the appropriate palette entry.
